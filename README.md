# data-generator-to-train-deep-learning
This data generator will create a CSV with a name column "noms" and a product reference column "objets".

The names are from the official list of firstnames registered in France (around 20000)
the product references are 9 digits numbers automaticaly generated every time you run the code. I limited the number of product references to 50 to have clusters

each name has a random number of product reference linked to it.
